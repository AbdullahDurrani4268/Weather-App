Faslon ko takaluf hai hamse agar. Ham bhi baybus nahi bay sahara nahi. Khud unhi ko pukarienge ham door se
raaste mein agar paaon thak jayeinge.

## Project Overview
This Weather Dashboard application is a web-based tool that provides users with current weather conditions, a 5-day weather forecast, and interactive weather charts. 
It includes two main pages: a **Dashboard** for general weather information and charts, and a **Table** page for viewing the forecast data in a tabular format. 
Additionally, the application features a chatbot capable of handling weather-related questions.

The app uses the **OpenWeather API** to fetch weather data, **Chart.js** for visualizing weather conditions and **Gemini API** to integrate with the chatbot.

## Features

### Current Weather Display:
- Users can search for weather by entering a city or using their geolocation.
- Displays current temperature, weather description, humidity, wind speed, and weather icons.
- Option to toggle between Celsius and Fahrenheit.

### 5-Day Weather Forecast:
- Provides a 5-day forecast in both graphical (Dashboard) and tabular (Tables) format.
- The table contains filters (ascending, descending, rainy days and highest temperature) to provide more clearer view.
- Charts available: Bar chart, Doughnut chart, and Line chart for temperature trends and weather conditions.

### Geolocation Support:
- Fetches the current location's weather and forecast using the device's geolocation.

### Chatbot:
- A chatbot integrated with the **Gemini API** that can answer weather-related questions based on the forecast data.

## Project Structure

- `weather.html`: Main entry point, displaying the weather dashboard.
- `table.html`: Displays weather forecast data in a table format.
- `app.js`: Contains all JavaScript functionality for the dashboard page, including API calls and chart creation.
- `app2.js`: Contains the logic for the table page, chatbot functionality, and additional forecast filtering and pagination.
- `styles.css` (integrated in the HTML): Contains custom styles for different weather conditions and UI elements.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML5 & CSS3**: For the structure and styling of the web pages.
- **JavaScript**: For dynamic content updates and fetching data from APIs.
- **Tailwind CSS**: For responsive design and utility-based styling.
- **Chart.js**: For creating dynamic charts based on weather data.
- **Font Awesome**: For using icons in the UI.
- **OpenWeather API**: To fetch real-time weather data.
- **Gemini API**: To power the chatbot's responses.
